# Ansible 4 Kali
>  Manually configuring Kali? Ain't nobody got time for that.

These playbooks install most of the tools that I require with some tweaks for hardening, personalization, and making Kali quieter.

How to use
------

- Install Kali using the default install. See https://github.com/iesplin/kali-preseed for an example
- Clone this repo 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iesplin/ansible-playbook-kali
    ```
- Run the deploy script
    ```bash
    cd ansible-playbook-kali
    ./deploy.sh
    ```
